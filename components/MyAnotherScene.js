  Don’t expect to learn how to win arguments
   by reading law professor Stanley Fish’s treatise.
    His main premise is that arguments pervade every
    aspect of life, never truly end and, therefore, can’t
     have a victor – at least, not a permanent victor.
      If you accept the certainty of argument and
      embrace it as all encompassing, you have clear
      motivation to get better at “argumentation,”
      and this exploration will help. At the least,
      you might learn to avoid the most fruitless of
      all arguments – those with your partner or spouse.
       Fish writes more about the philosophy of argument
       than practical techniques, but if the way discourse unfolds intrigues you, you’ll enjoy his compelling exploration of why and how people disagree.
  What you will learn:
  • Why argument, not agreement, is the natural state of humanity; and
  • What types of arguments emerge in politics, law, marriage and academia.
